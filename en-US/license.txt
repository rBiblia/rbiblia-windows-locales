rBiblia is a free program which allows browsing, advanced searching and comparing different Bible translations.

Its minimum requirements are:
– a computer with Windows XP (x86/x64) or newer,
– installed .NET framework version 4.7.2 (checked during installation; if the installation wizard displays this window, it means the framework is installed already and you can continue),
– an Internet connection (to download new Bible translations).

From the rBiblia homepage you may download the legacy version 2.5.2, which requires .NET 3.5 and works under Windows XP/Vista.

As the author, I did my best to make the program work as it was intended to. I do not, however, take any responsibility for any damage resulting from its use.

I will be thankful for any remarks and ideas concerning its operation.
